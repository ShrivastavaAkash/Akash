    <p>For as long as I can remember I wanted to write a blog, and not just write it, but <strong>WRITE</strong> it too. By that, I mean I wanted that blog to be on a site that I wrote.</p>
<p>It's not that I haven't tried, it's just that I never really got around to complete it. I've been too busy shining my skills as a master procrastintor.</p>
<p>But, all's well that ends well and I think I ended up with a pretty good setup, especially considering the minimal efforts I've put in setting it.</p>
<p>Well, it's up now and apart from sharing my over exceitement, I also wanted my first blog to be about how I got it all set up. It's quite a minimal setup can be done quickly and for anyone who like this setup and design I welcome you to fork this and start your own.</p>

<h3 id="hosting">Hosting</h3>
<p>\
Hosting is pretty high up there in being one of the reasons why I procrastinated in setting up a website, I never researched enough and quickly bought one of those GoDaddy shared hosting for a little while, they expired quickly &amp; renewing those subscription being a desi guy always felt like a trap. </p>
<p>So, when I saw a friend's blog hosted on Github, hype was real! free hosting forever and with a pretty good domain name, too good to pass. I found <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a> to be the best option for me to exercise this little "Hobby" of blogging.</p>
<p>Storing images on Github however seemed a bit unnecessary to me, so I chose Pinterest to do the image hosting, so all the images you see linked in this blog are comiing from <a href="https://pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a>. </p>

<p>\
So, I got a new project at work and we chose to do it in with <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>, it wasn't the only reason for me to chose angular for this site, since I had wanted to learn at least one of these JavaScript frameworks, I even did some beginner work with <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> &amp; Angular for a while in the past, but never quite got into it. So, with that project and my new experience with Angular it seemed like a pretty goot deal to setup this site with it to both get more knowledge on Angular along with getting the site up.</p>
<p>I used Angular 8 (latest version around the time I started this project), with a <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> 4 for CSS along with moderate amount of customizations ofcourse.</p>
<p>Now, I know, it feels like being a little late to the party coming up with Angular + Bootstrap while all the cool kids are doing <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a> and <a href="https://material.angular.io/">Material</a> and stuff, but I quite liked how it turned out, and I kind of wanted to avoid sailing on two boats by chosing Angular at work and React at this side thing. </p>
<p>The last thing is this cool markdown parser for Angular called <a href="https://github.com/jfcere/ngx-markdown">ngx-markdown</a>, it does all the hardwork, I really love writing markdowns on Git and Confluence and that's why i chose this package, it does great job with loading <code>.md</code> files and rendering them as <code>HTML</code>, all I do is write my blogs in markdown and <em>Voila!</em> great stuff. It also provides syntax hightlighting for the embedded code blocks in markdowns with the help of <a href="http://prismjs.com/">Prism.js</a>, which is definietely helpful as I certainly am going to need that in upcoming posts.</p>
<hr />
<p>It's not all over yet, I'm thinking to add a <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/comments/">Facebook's comments plugin</a> along with some SEO meta tags management logic for these blogs in some time soon. That'll probably complete this. </p>
<p>Feeling good about this.</p>
